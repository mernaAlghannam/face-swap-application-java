# face-swap-application-java
Code in progress..
The main part of the program is to input two face in which the program will swap. It also has some image editing components.

What's missing? 
I ahve removed the C++ component that is meant to swap the two faces as it is currently buggy. I also remoed some image editing components that I will fix.
