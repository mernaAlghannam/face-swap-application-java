# face-swap-application-java-2019
Code in progress..
This is a final project that I have completed in my introduction to Java course, Fall 2019. The main part of the program is to input two face in which the program will swap. It also has some image editing components.

What's missing? 
I have removed the C++ component that is meant to swap the two faces as it is currently buggy. It was connected to my java code. I also removed some image editing components that I will fix.
